Hi Everyone,

## This is my Microsoft Power BI Dashboard,

Before two years ago me(Sohail Shaikh) I and my friend Saurabh Dange think to create the "Analysis of Modern Relation" application, We gather some data from our family and friends.

After that #PreapareData and did #Analysis on this data and perform #Model then #Manage to #Visualize data.

For creating a dashboard I follow some steps as follows
Step 1: Extract data
Step 2: Transform data
Step 3: Load data
Step 3: Data Modeling
Step 4: Writing DAX
Step 5: Report Building
Step 6: Publish Report
Step 7: Dashboard Creation
Step 8: Share & Collaborate
